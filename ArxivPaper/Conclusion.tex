\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a Levenberg-Maquardt based algorithm that
uses the Wirtinger's framework for complex derivative. The Jacobian
harbors a different structure that is sparser than in the classical
case. Based on this, a new optimisation algorithm has been
presented (\COH).

This framework, and its connection with existing algorithms will be
further discussed in \citet[][in prep.]{SmirnovTasse14}.
