\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a Levenberg-Maquardt based algorithm that
uses the Wirtinger's framework for complex derivative. The jacobian
harbors a different structure that is sparser than in the classical
case. Based on this a new optimisation algorithm (\COH) has been
presented.

This framework, and its connection with existing algorithms will be
further discussed in \citet[][in prep.]{SmirnovTasse14}.
