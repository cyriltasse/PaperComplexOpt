\section{Connection with other existing algorithms}
\label{sec:Connection}

In this section, we investigate the connections between the complex
optimisation point of view (see Sec. \ref{sec:Wirtinger} and
\ref{sec:Solver}) and the existing algorithm. We show that antenna
based calibration schemes are always obtainable using this framework,
while general pealing based approaches are appliable under certain condition
of orthogonality between Fourier kernels.
