\caption{\label{fig:ReprSig} We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study
  the ability of the Unscented Transform to properly describe the data
  statistics after the non-linear measurement operator and the
  different representation operators $\mathR$
  (Sec. \ref{sec:ReprSecIntro}) have been applied to the process
  domain. Here we consider the case of a frequency-dependent phase
  gradient (clock offset, ionospheric effect, or source position
  offset). We have subtracted the true mean $\left<\mathR\right>_{MC}$ to each quantity plotted
  in this figure. The true covariance corresponds to the gray area,
  while the sigma points appear as dotted lines, together with their
  associated estimated covariance (thick dashed line). The noise in
  the data is represented by the dash-dotted line. Qualitatively, the
  goodness of the description depends on the type of the data
  representations operator.}
